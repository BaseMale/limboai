**LimboAI** is a C++ module for **Godot Engine 4** that provides an implementation of Behavior Trees and State Machines, which can be used together to create complex AI behaviors.

>**ðŸ›ˆ Supported Godot Engine: 4.2**

>**ðŸ›ˆ Previously supported:** [godot-4.1](https://github.com/limbonaut/limboai/tree/godot-4.1)

A Behavior Tree (BT) is a powerful hierarchical structure used to model and control the behavior of agents in a game. It comprises tasks that represent specific actions or decision-making rules. When executed, the Behavior Tree starts from the root task and traverses down to the leaf tasks, which correspond to the actual actions or behaviors that the agent should perform. For detailed information on how various BT tasks function, please refer to the class documentation. The BehaviorTree class serves as a good starting point.

## Features

- **Behavior Trees (BT):**
    - Easily create, edit, and save `BehaviorTree` resources in the editor.
    - Execute `BehaviorTree` resources using the `BTPlayer` node.
    - Create complex behaviors by combining and nesting tasks in a hierarchy.
    - Control execution flow using composite, decorator, and condition tasks.
    - [Create custom tasks](./doc/getting-started.md#creating-custom-tasks-in-gdscript) by extending core classes: `BTAction`, `BTCondition`, `BTDecorator`, and `BTComposite`.
    - Built-in class documentation. Check out the `BehaviorTree` class documentation to get started.
    - Share data seamlessly between tasks using the `Blackboard`.
    - Blackboard scopes isolate variable namespaces and enable advanced techniques like sharing data between agents in a group.
    - Use the `BTSubtree` task to execute a tree from a different resource file, promoting organization and reusability.
    - Visual Debugger: Inspect the execution of any BT in a running scene to identify and troubleshoot issues.
    - Monitor tree performance with custom performance monitors.

- **Hierarchical State Machines (HSM):**
    - Extend the `LimboState` class to implement state logic.
    - The `LimboHSM` node serves as a state machine that manages `LimboState` instances and transitions.
    - `LimboHSM` is a state itself and can be nested within other `LimboHSM` instances.
    - Event-based: Transitions are associated with events and are triggered by the state machine when the relevant event is dispatched, allowing for better decoupling of transitions from state logic.
    - Combine state machines with behavior trees using `BTState` for advanced reactive AI.
    - Delegation Option: Using the vanilla `LimboState`, delegate the implementation to your callback functions, making it perfect for rapid prototyping and game jams.
    - ðŸ›ˆ Note: State machine setup and initialization require code; there is no GUI editor.

- **Tested:** Behavior tree tasks and HSM are covered by unit tests.

## Getting LimboAI

### Precompiled builds

- For the most recent builds, navigate to **Actions** â†’ [**All Builds**](https://github.com/limbonaut/limboai/actions/workflows/all_builds.yml), select a build from the list, and scroll down until you find the **Artifacts** section.
- For release builds, check [**Releases**](https://github.com/limbonaut/limboai/releases).

### Compiling from source

- Download the Godot Engine source code and put this module source into the `modules/limboai` directory.
- Consult the Godot Engine documentation for instructions on [how to build from source code](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/index.html).
- If you plan to export a game utilizing the LimboAI module, you'll also need to build export templates.
- To execute unit tests, compile the engine with `tests=yes` and run it with `--test --tc="*[LimboAI]*"`.

## Roadmap

Features and improvements that may be implemented in the future:
- ~~Providing precompiled builds for download.~~ ðŸ—¸
- ~~Tests and CI.~~ ðŸ—¸
- Expanding the library of commonly useful tasks.
- Creating a non-trivial demo project to showcase the capabilities of LimboAI.
- Exploring the execution history of behavior trees in the visual debugger.
- Per-project ignore list for tasks that users may want to hide in the task palette.
- GUI editor for state machines.
- Supporting GDExtension in the future, once it matures.
