		Decorator is a task in a [BehaviorTree] that alters the behavior of its child task. Can only have a single child.
		It can be used to add conditions, limits, or other constraints to the execution of a task. Examples of [BehaviorTree] decorators include [BTInvert], [BTRepeat], and [BTCooldown]. The use of [BehaviorTree] decorators can help to simplify the design and implementation of complex behaviors by adding additional logic to existing tasks.
