	<description>
		Base class for all [BehaviorTree] conditions. Extend [code]BTCondition[/code] to create your own conditions.
		Condition is a task in a [BehaviorTree] that checks for a specific condition before executing subsequent tasks and often used inside composite tasks to control the execution flow. It is used to verify the state of the environment, check for the presence of an enemy, or evaluate the health status of the agent. The use of [BehaviorTree] condition tasks can improve the efficiency of the system and avoid unnecessary actions. However, it may not be suitable for complex decision-making processes, and too many condition tasks can make the [BehaviorTree] difficult to read.
		Conditions usually don't take multiple ticks to finish and return [code]SUCCESS[/code] or [code]BT.FAILURE[/code] immeditely.
