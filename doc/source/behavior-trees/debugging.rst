Debugging Behavior Trees
========================

In Godot Engine, follow to "Bottom Panel > Debugger > LimboAI" tab. With the LimboAI debugger,
you can inspect any currently active behavior tree within the running project. The debugger can be detached
from the main editor window, which can be particularly useful if you have a HiDPI or a secondary display.
